In recent years, there have been rise in the number of applications based on Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) systems and have been successfully applied to different areas as diverse as 
transportation, health-care, agriculture, and hospitality industry to name a few. RFID technology 
facilitates automatic wireless identification using electronic passive and active tags with suitable 
readers. In this project, an attempt is made to solve recurrent lecture attendance monitoring 
problem in developing countries using RFID technology. The application of RFID to student 
attendance monitoring as developed and deployed in this study is capable of eliminating time 
wasted during manual collection of attendance and an opportunity for the educational
administrators to capture face-to-face classroom statistics for allocation of appropriate attendance 
scores and for further managerial decisions
